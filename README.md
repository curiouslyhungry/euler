Euler 
===================


I have decided to have a go at a few of the project Euler problems from https://projecteuler.net/.  I'm doing this for a number of reasons

 1. My maths is, at best, stale so it'll be nice to learn some useful maths.
 2. Whilst I have coded in a I'm not really completely comfortable in Python, so hopefully this will help that.
 3. I want to try some different git workflows
 4. I want to investigate some unit testing frameworks
 5. As ever, I'm hoping to discover some things I am not looking for.
